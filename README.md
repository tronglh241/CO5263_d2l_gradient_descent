# CO5263 M4CS Assignment on the topic of Gradient Descent

This repository contains the assignment report for the course **Mathematical Foundations for Computer Science**, focusing on the topic of **Gradient Descent (GD), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Mini-batch SGD**.

The main report is presented in a comprehensive Jupyter notebook located at:
`notebooks/report.ipynb`

In addition, we provide separate notebooks in `notebooks/` for each section of the report to facilitate modular understanding:

* `01_introduction.ipynb` – Introduction to the topic
* `02_gradient_descent.ipynb` – Gradient Descent
* `03_stochastic_gradient_descent.ipynb` – Stochastic Gradient Descent
* `04_minibatch_stochastic_gradient_descent.ipynb` – Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent
